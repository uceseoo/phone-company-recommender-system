## Phone-company-recommender-system
A recommender system for phone company customers can use data about the customer's past behavior, such as the types of plans they have purchased and the features they use, to make personalized recommendations for new plans or features that may be of interest to the customer. This can be done using machine learning algorithms that analyze the customer's data and compare it to other similar customers to identify patterns and trends.

For example, if a customer has consistently purchased plans with a large amount of data, the recommender system might recommend a new plan with an even larger data allowance or a discounted rate for additional data. If the customer frequently uses features such as international calling or mobile hotspot, the system might recommend a plan that includes these features at a discounted rate.

The recommendations can be presented to the customer through various channels, such as email, SMS, or in-app notifications, to make it easy for the customer to review and take action on the suggestions. Additionally, the system can be integrated with the phone company's sales and support systems to make it easy for customers to learn more about the recommended plans and to make purchases or changes to their existing plans.

This code is an example of how a recommender system might recommend a new plan to customers.

In this example, the customer data is loaded from a CSV file and the relevant features are selected for use in clustering. The data is then standardized using the StandardScaler class from the sklearn library, and K-Means clustering is used to identify customer segments. The cluster labels are added to the customer data, and then the system iterates through each customer and recommends a new plan based on the average plan data for customers in the same cluster.
